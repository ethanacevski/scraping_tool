# scraping_tool

### Part 1

1. Booking.com contains a large quantity of listings for Australia, we want to scrape these for the 1st-2nd February 2026 (Search). 
2. Use Selenium (Python) to scrape all listings:
    - Title
    - Address
    - Headline Room Type
    - Cost (AUD)
    - Review Score
    - \# of Reviews
3. Scrape as many listings as you can, however your code should be designed to handle an arbitrary number of listings. Care should be taken to mimic human-like behaviour.
4. Structure your output in a CSV.
